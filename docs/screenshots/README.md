# Screenshot Placeholders

Capture and drop screenshots in this directory when the UI is running locally:

1. `home.png` – Landing page with movie filters and listings.
2. `movie-details.png` – Movie detail view with theatre showtimes.
3. `seat-selection.png` – Booking page showing seat map and booking form.
4. `confirmation.png` – Booking confirmation banner with summary.

These placeholder names are referenced in documentation; replace them with actual images before release if visual assets are required.
